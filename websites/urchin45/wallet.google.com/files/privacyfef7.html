            The <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html">Google Privacy
            Policy</a> describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's products
            and services. In addition, the following describes our privacy practices that are
            specific to the Google Wallet services provided by Google Inc. and its wholly-owned
            subsidiaries. Capitalized terms not defined in this Google Wallet Privacy Policy shall
            have the meaning ascribed to them in the <a href=

            "Google Wallet" refers to the following Google payment services:
          </p>
          <p>
            The Processing Service which allows the storage of payment instruments and processing
            of online payment transactions with participating merchants; and
          </p>
          <p>
            Mobile Wallet which allows you to (i) make purchases at participating retail locations
            using an application on your smartphone with near-field communication
            (“<strong>NFC</strong>”) capabilities (i.e., the Mobile Wallet Application); and (ii)
            make purchases on participating merchant websites from the mobile browser on your smart
            phone.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Information that we collect and how we use it
          </h2>
          <blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Registration information</strong> - When you sign up for Google Wallet, we
                ask that you associate your Google Wallet account with a Google Account so that we
                can provide you with the service. If you register a Carrier Billing Account, the
                information that we require to register for the service includes your mobile
                telephone number, and the name and billing address associated with that number. For
                sellers, we also require you to provide your bank account number and, in some
                situations, your personal address, your business category, a government-issued
                identification number (for example, social security number or taxpayer
                identification number for US residents) and certain information about your sales or
                transaction volume. This information allows us to process payments and protect
                users from fraud. In some cases, we may also ask you to send us additional
                information or to answer additional questions to help verify your information. The
                information we collect is stored in association with your <a href=
                "http://www.google.com/accounts/?hl=en-us">Google Account</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Registration of a Payment Method</strong> - If you store a payment method
                with Google Wallet, information that may be required includes, as applicable, your
                name, credit or debit card number, card expiration date, address, phone number,
                email address, date of birth and last four digits of Social Security number. This
                information may be stored on Google servers to synchronize your payment methods
                between the Mobile Wallet Application on your phone and the Processing Service.
                Data elements regarding card verification number (CVN) may be stored on the mobile
                device in encrypted form, but not on Google’s servers. We may also receive
                information about the provisioning of the payment method to your device.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Information obtained from third parties</strong> - In order to protect you
                from fraud or other misconduct, we may obtain information about you from third
                parties to verify the information you provide. For example, we may use card
                authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your credit or debit card
                information and address match the information that you provided to us. Also, for
                sellers using the Processing Service, we may obtain information about you and your
                business from a credit bureau or a business information service such as Dun &amp;
                Bradstreet. We also may obtain information from third parties in connection with
                providing Google Wallet to you, such as information arising from Google Wallet
                transactions at merchant locations and information from the Carrier in connection
                with Carrier Billing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Transaction information</strong> - When you use the Processing Service to
                conduct a transaction, we collect information about each transaction, including the
                transaction amount, a description provided by the seller of the goods or services
                being purchased, the names of the seller and buyer and the type of payment used. We
                may also collect transaction data from your use of the Mobile Wallet. For example,
                if you use the Mobile Wallet Application to make a purchase at a merchant or
                download a merchant coupon, we may obtain information regarding that transaction
                from the Mobile Wallet Application, from the merchant and/or a partner, as
                applicable. The information may include the date and time of the purchase, the
                store location, the amount of the purchase, and the offer associated with the
                transaction.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Information collected to prevent fraud</strong> - In order to protect you
                from fraud, phishing and other misconduct, we may collect information about your
                interaction with the service to help validate your identity or detect potentially
                fraudulent conduct. For example, in some circumstances we may try to determine
                service usage patterns (such as how quickly you type) so that we can try to detect
                and prevent unauthorized attempts to access your account (such as automated hacking
                attacks or the use of stolen usernames or passwords). Any such information that we
                collect will only be used to detect and prevent fraud or other misconduct, unless
                you explicitly grant us permission to use it in another manner.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Information about your use of Google Wallet</strong> - We may collect
                information about your interaction with the Mobile Wallet. This may include, for
                example, data on number of offers saved, payment attempts, and provisioning
                activity. Using added services may require your opt-in consent for Google Wallet to
                offer the functionality. For example, you may be offered the opportunity to opt-in
                to a service whereby Mobile Wallet would present offers to you based on your past
                transaction activities.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Offer information</strong> - If you choose to clip and save an offer, we
                will collect the offer and provision it to the Mobile Wallet Application on your
                mobile device.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Google cookies</strong> - When you access a Google Wallet through a
                browser, we send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of
                characters - to your computer to uniquely identify your browser. We use cookies to
                improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user
                trends. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset
                your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
                Please note that you will not be able to access certain features of Google Wallet
                if your cookies are disabled.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Log information</strong> - When you use Google Wallet through a browser,
                our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you
                visit a website. These <a href=
                "http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/faq.html#serverlogs">server logs</a> may
                include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser
                type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies
                that may uniquely identify your browser.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Device information</strong> – When you use Google Wallet through a mobile
                device, we may collect information about your phone (including device and hardware
                IDs) for technical support and debugging purposes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>User communications</strong> - When you send an email or other
                communication to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your
                enquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Links</strong> - We may present links in a format that enables us to keep
                track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve
                the quality of our search technology, customized content and advertising. For more

              We will not sell or rent your personal information to companies or individuals

                credit card payment, if you process a credit card transaction through the
                Processing Service, we need to share some information (for example, your name and
                credit card number) with the banks and other entities in the financial system that
                process credit card transactions. For payment transactions processed through your

              When you shop at a seller for the first time and complete an order, you’ll be given a
              choice whether you'd like to receive promotional emails from the seller. If you
              decide later that you don't want to receive promotional emails from a seller, you
              will need to contact the seller directly.

              If Google or its subsidiaries become involved in a merger, acquisition or any form of
              sale of some or all of their assets, we will provide notice before personal
              information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

              Information security
            </h2>
            <p>
              We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or
              unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data that is stored at Google
              in connection with Google Wallet. These include internal reviews of our data
              collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as
              physical and technical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to
              systems where we store personal data. For example, your credit card number will
              always be stored in an encrypted form (except when you provide it to us in a
              communication outside our web page interface).
            </p>
            <p>
              The security of your Google Wallet account also depends on keeping your account
              password confidential, and you should not share your account name or password with
              anyone. If you do share your account information with a third party, they will have
              access to your account and your personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Google Wallet Service information security program does not apply to any
              information, such as information arising from a Third Party Provider Wallet Service,
              that is stored on your Google Wallet Application, as that information is outside of
              the Google-controlled data centers. It is your responsibility to control access to
              your mobile device and the Google Wallet Application on your device, including
              keeping your PIN confidential and not sharing it with anyone. It is your
              responsibility to alert Google or the relevant partner if you believe that the
              security of the information in the Google Wallet Application has been compromised.

              You can review and update your payment information available through the Processing
              Service by logging in to your Google Account or the Mobile Wallet Application and
              going to the 'Purchase History' page, where you can update or remove your address and
              method of payment. You can also view your previous transaction history on the

              Wallet can be disabled through the Mobile Wallet Application. If you do so, your
              payment information and transaction history will no longer be viewable through Google
              Wallet. However, in order to meet our reporting and auditing obligations and to
              detect, deter as well as prevent fraud or other misconduct on our systems, the
              information will be retained in our systems for so long as there remains a business
              necessity. If you disable Google Wallet, your personally identifiable information
              will not be used by Google or shared with third parties except for these purposes. We
              may delete these records over time if permitted or required by law.
