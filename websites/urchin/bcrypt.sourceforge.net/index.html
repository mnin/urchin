<title>Bcrypt - Blowfish File Encryption</title>

<h1><b>bcrypt</b></h1>
</center>
<i>There are two kinds of cryptography in this world: cryptography
that will stop your kid sister from reading your files, and
cryptography that will stop major governments from reading your
files. This book is about the latter.<br>
<center> -- Preface to Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier</i></center>

<hr />
<b>Description</b> 


<p>Bcrypt is a cross platform file encryption utility. Encrypted
files are portable across all supported operating systems and
processors. Passphrases must be between 8 and 56 characters and are
hashed internally to a 448 bit key. However, all characters
supplied are significant. The stronger your passphrase, the more
secure your data.</p>

<p>In addition to encrypting your data, bcrypt will by default
overwrite the original input file with random garbage three times
before deleting it in order to thwart data recovery attempts by
persons who may gain access to your computer. If you're not quite
ready for this level of paranoia yet, see the installation
instructions below for how to disable this feature. If you don't
think this is paranoid enough.. see below.</p>

<p>Bcrypt uses the blowfish encryption algorithm published by Bruce
Schneier in 1993. More information on the algorithm can be found at
<a href="http://www.counterpane.com/blowfish.html">Counterpane</a>.
Specifically, bcrypt uses Paul Kocher's implementation of the
algorithm. The source distributed with bcrypt has been slightly
altered from the original. Original source code can be obtained
from <a
href="http://www.counterpane.com/bfsh-koc.zip">http://www.counterpane.com/bfsh-koc.zip</a>.</p>

<b>Supported Platforms</b> 
<p>Bcrypt has been successfully tested on the following platforms:</p>

<b>x86:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Linux, Cygwin, Win32<br>
<b>Sparc R220:</b><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Solaris 2.7, 2.8<br>
<b> Sparc Ultra60:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Linux 2.4<br>
<b> Alpha:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Linux 2.4<br>
<b> PPC G4:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    MacOS X 10.1 SERVER<br>
<b> PPC RS/6000:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Linux 2.4<br>
<b> MIPS: </b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Linux 2.0.34 (Cobalt)<br>
<b> HPPA 1.1 </b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    HP-UX 11.0<br>

<p>No other operating systems
have been tested, but most should work with minimal modifications.
If you get bcrypt to compile without errors on any other platform
or architecture, I'd like to know about it. If patches are
necessary to get bcrypt work on your OS, I will try to incorporate
them into the main distribution.</p>

<p>If you have a machine not listed above that is incapable of
compiling bcrypt and are willing to give me access to the machine,
I will make an attempt to port it to your OS.</p>

<b>News</b> (Updated September 11, 2002)
<p>Bcrypt 1.1 fixes a few minor bugs and adds support for many new operating
systems. If you previously used 1.0 on an unsupported platform, you may not
be able to decrypt any encrypted files you have. Alpha systems are known to
have this problem. 32 bit systems should not have this problem. 64 bit 
systems probably do. If your system exhibits this problem, you should decrypt 
your files with 1.0 and reencrypt them with 1.1.</p>

<p>1.1 is immensely faster than 1.0. Additionally, it uses about 50% as much 
memory with compression turned off, or 66% with compression on.</p>

<b>Compatibility testing</b>
<p>The following files are copies of the LICENSE file that have been encrypted 
with the passphrase 'eggheads'. If you can decrypt both, then your 
installation should be compatible with any other supported systems.</p>

<hr />
<b>Installation</b> 

<p>If you're so inclined, edit config.h and change the defaults to
whatever you think is appropriate for your needs. If you choose not
to have bcrypt remove input files after processing, or set
SECUREDELETE to 0, you are likely to have data on your hard drive
that can be recovered even after deletion. All of these options can
be set on the command line as well.</p>

<p>When you're satisfied with the default settings, simply
type:<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>make</b><br />
then su and type:<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>make install</b><br />
 It would be wise to test the installation on a few unimportant
files before encrypting anything you value, removing the only copy
and overwriting it 127 times with garbage.</p>

<hr />
<b>Usage</b> 

<p>bcrypt [-orc][-sN] file ...</p>

<p>Encrypted files will be saved with an extension of .bfe. Any
files ending in .bfe will be assumed to be encrypted with bcrypt
and will attempt to decrypt them. Any other input files will be
encrypted. If more than one type of file is given, bcrypt will
process all files which are the same as the first filetype
given.</p>

<p>By default, bcrypt will compress input files before encryption,
remove input files after they are processed (assuming they are
processed successfully) and overwrite input files with random data
to prevent data recovery.</p>

<p>Passphrases may be between 8 and 56 characters. Regardless of
the passphrase size, the key is hashed internally to 448 bits - the
largest keysize supported by the blowfish algorithm. However, it is
still wise to use a strong passphrase.</p>

<p><b>Options</b></p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>-o</td>
<td>print output to standard out. Implies -r.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-c</td>
<td>DO NOT compress files before encryption.</td>
</tr>

<tr>

<td>-r</td>
<td>DO NOT remove input files after processing</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-sN</td>
<td>How many times to overwrite input files with random data before
processing. The default number of overwrites is 3. Use -s0 to
disable this feature. No effect if -r is supplied.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<b>Note</b> 

<p>The options o,c and r each have the opposite effects if the
appropriate settings are altered from the default in config.h.</p>

<p>Encrypted files should be compatible between most systems.
Binary compatibility has been tested for all systems listed above.</p>
